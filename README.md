# Hotel-Chain-performance-Analysis
Performance analysis on a Hospitality domain. 

## Key Metrics
### Average Daily Rate (ADR)
It is the ratio of revenue to the total rooms booked/sold. It is the measure of the average paid for rooms sold in a given time period

### Revenue Per Available Room (RevPAR)
RevPAR represents the revenue generated per available room, whether or not they are occupied. RevPAR helps hotels measure their 
revenue generating performance to accurately price rooms. RevPAR can help hotels measure themselves against other properties or brands

### Daily Sellable Room Nights (DSRN)
This metric tells on average how many rooms are ready to sell for a day considering a time period

### Realization
It is nothing but the successful "checked out" percentage overall bookings happened.

# Insights

## Overview
![1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6bf0d051-66de-48c9-825d-9108b9e3f618)

The daily sellable rooms per night are 3k, and the substantial revenue is 1,687 million. Revpar 7.34k and ADR is 12.7k. The occupancy is 58% which is an opportunity to increase revenue. While realization is 70% which is good but can be improved. 

## Trends

We see that RevPar and ADR are highly coefficient, this tells us that the Hotel chain does not use a Dynamic Pricing strategy, which can improve revenue. 

## Ratings

Table of hotels and their cities with their key metrics, sorted in ascending order by average ratings. We can see which hotel is performing poorly by the ratings given to it. 

## Ranking by City
![4](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d74a0abb-ee26-439b-abbc-2d77d734e5de)

We can Observe that in revenue, hotels in Mumbai are performing better than others and hotels in Delhi are lowest performing.

## Booking Platform performance

The key observation here is that Online bookings are made less and are mostly made offline, which may hint at the low presence of the Hotel chain on these platforms or poor advertising. 

## Suggestions 
1. Implementing a Dynamic pricing strategy 
2. To initiate level 2 analysis on the hotels with poor ratings
3. Investigating the low revenue in cities like Delhi
4. Create a presence in booking platforms, and create incentives (eg: offers) on its main online site.
